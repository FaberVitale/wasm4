# wasm4-runtime

This workspace contains the web runtime.

## Development

First run `npm install` to install dependencies.

For quick development run `npm start` and navigate to http://localhost:8080. You will also need to
place a test cart in dist/cart.wasm.

Run `npm run build` to build a release build, which is used by the website and the `w4` CLI.
